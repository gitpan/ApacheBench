This is ApacheBench/Perl, a Perl API for Apache benchmarking
and regression testing.

This project is meant to be the foundation of a complete
benchmarking and regression testing suite for a transaction-
processing mod_perl site.  We needed to be able to stress our
server to its limit while also having a way to verify the
HTTP responses for correctness.  We also extended the
single-URL ab model to a multiple-URL sequence model.

ApacheBench was originally based on the Apache 1.3.12 ab code
(src/support/ab.c).  Since the initial release, I have made
efforts to merge in all the newest features of ab.
As of version 0.62 it has almost all the features of
Apache 1.3.22 ab.  However, since the code has so much
more/different functionality than "ab" at this point, it's
almost pointless to continue merging code.  It's an entirely
different project now.

Please see the POD for complete details.
