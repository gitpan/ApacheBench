This is ApacheBench version 0.62, the Perl API for Apache
benchmarking and regression testing.

This project is meant to be the foundation of a complete
benchmarking and regression testing suite for a transaction-
processing mod_perl site.  We needed to be able to stress our
server to its limit while also having a way to verify the
HTTP responses for correctness.  We also extended the
single-URL ab model to a multiple-URL sequence model.

ApacheBench is based on the Apache 1.3.12 ab code
(src/support/ab.c).  Since the initial release, I have made
efforts to merge in all the newest features of ab.
Currently (v0.62) it has almost all the features of
Apache 1.3.22 ab.

Please see the POD for complete details.

NOTE: For people upgrading from 0.5x, please see the file
README.upgrading_0.5x-0.6x.  There have been changes
to the API, so your scripts based on 0.5x will not work
with 0.6x unless you make some modifications to them.
