This is ApacheBench version 0.52, the Perl API for Apache
benchmarking and regression testing.

This project is meant to be the foundation for a complete
benchmarking and regression testing suite for an advanced,
transaction-based mod_perl site.  We need to be able to
stress our server to its limit while also having a way to
verify the HTTP responses for correctness.  Since our site
is transaction-based (as opposed to content-based), we
needed to extend the single-URL ab model to a multiple-URL
sequence model.

ApacheBench is based on the Apache 1.3.12 ab code
(src/support/ab.c).

Please see the POD for complete details.
