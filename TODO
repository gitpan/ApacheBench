1) add global option to not store any page content, in order
   to reduce memory usage
2) standardize the API to use only method calls, instead of
   sending large hashes to config() and add(), and reading the
   very large regression hash from execute()
3) completely re-implement ab using Perl API (need to add some
   features like arbitrary HTTP request headers)
